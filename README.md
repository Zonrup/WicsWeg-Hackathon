Instructions:
Set up the 'faces' you will be notifying in the SETTINGS menu.
Set up your SOS contact to be called in an emergency
For an SOS action, select SOS button then click send and a call will be made to the set SOS contact.
For any other actions, select the contacts to be notified, select the action and hit send.
A text message will be sent to the selected contacts along with your location if your location is enabled.
You can customize the actions, create your own and change which default actions to have on the homepage.
